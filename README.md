## 🛠️ Setting Up
1. **Configure your environment:**
   Ensure your Android device supports Linux Chroot environments. You may need additional applications like Termux or a similar tool to set this up.

2. **Establish a connection:**
   Neuro-Bridge uses Unix Domain Sockets for communication. Ensure that your Chroot environment is properly configured to recognize these sockets.

3. **Test hardware acceleration:**
   After setup, check if your device's hardware components are being utilized. You can run a simple computational task or an AI inference task to validate the functionality.

## 📖 Troubleshooting
- **Installation Issues:** 
  Ensure that "Install from Unknown Sources" is enabled. If the installation fails, try re-downloading the file.

- **Connection Problems:** 
  If you're having trouble connecting to your Chroot environment, double-check your configuration settings. You might need to restart the app or the Chroot session.

- **Performance Not as Expected:**
  Verify that other resource-intensive applications are closed. Sometimes, device performance can be affected by other running apps.
